This Streamlit app allows users to predict call center performance metrics such as First Call Resolution (FCR) and Churn Rate. Users can input their current performance metrics and select the metric they want to improve. The app provides predictions, feature importance, model accuracy, and detailed model evaluation using Shapash.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Model and Metric Selection**: Choose between improving FCR or Churn and select the model type (Gradient Boosting or Random Forest).
- **Input Performance Metrics**: Input your current performance metrics to get predictions.
- **Predictions**: Get predicted values for FCR or Churn based on your inputs.
- **Feature Importance**: View the feature importance for the selected model.
- **Model Accuracy**: See the R-squared or accuracy score of the selected model.
- **Model Evaluation with Shapash**: Generate detailed model evaluation reports using Shapash, including feature importance and contribution plots.

## Models üß†

The following models are used in this app:
- Gradient Boosting for Churn Prediction: `best_gb_churn_model.pkl`
- Gradient Boosting for FCR Prediction: `best_gb_fcr_model.pkl`
- Random Forest for Churn Prediction: `best_rf_churn_model.pkl`
- Random Forest for FCR Prediction: `best_rf_fcr_model.pkl`
